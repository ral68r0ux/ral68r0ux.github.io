      <h1>About North Ogden</h1>
      <p>Among the first people to dwell in the North Ogden area were Native American Indians. Most of these people were
        Shoshone, belonging to tribes such as the Paiutes, Utes, Shoshones, Goshutes, and Bannocks. These bands led a
        nomadic lifestyle with their annual movements driven by the availability of water, edible vegetation, and wild
        game. The Shoshone called the area “Opecarry,” which translated to “stick in the head.” Their trails connected
        the North Ogden territory with areas now known as Liberty, Huntsville, Eden, Ogden, and Cache Valley, Utah.</p>
      <p>European Americans first visited the North Ogden area in the early 1820s. They were primarily trappers who were
        more interested in the rich harvest of beaver furs than in establishing permanent settlements. The first record
        of a visit to “Ogden Hole” (now known as North Ogden) was in 1821 by a trapper named Etienne Provost, who farmed
        the area along with others until about 1844, when trapper Miles Goodyear purchased most of the land from Ogden
        Canyon to North Ogden Canyon. The Ogden name derived from Peter Skeen Ogden <a

    <div class="cherryDays">
      <h1>Cherry Days History</h1>
      <p>In 1932 a group of civic and church leaders in North Ogden formed a committee to improve the cherry market
        throughout the Western states. They started an annual community celebration to call attention to the size, color
        and flavor of their cherries and to acquaint people with the beauty of the area and the high quality of
        community and family life. 28 growers from North Ogden and 7 from out of town contributed cherries to an exhibit
        of 166 cases, believed to be the largest display of cherries ever seen in Utah. Everyone ate free cherries. The
        first slogan to help popularize North Ogden was “North Ogden, Where Flavor Fills the Fruit.”</p>
      <p>n 1954 the cherries of North Ogden received wide-spread recognition when Mrs. Beverly Erickson <a
